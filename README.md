# Cryptocurrencies

![Oops](readme_photo/whoops.jpeg)

For this challenge Martha wants to assist Accountability Accounting in creating a cryptocurrency portfolio. Our job is to filter out and find good investment opportunities using unsupervised machine learning.
A clustering algorithm was chosen to properly organize the data and figure out which currencies to invest in.

Data preprocessing was used to make the data provided by Martha usable and clean for the machine learning to more accurately organize and make predictions on the data. It involves getting rid of null values and crypto that weren't even mined. Reducing data dimensions was used to standardize and transform the data. Clustering was used to predict clusters for organization for investments and visualizing was just that, visualizing the findings.
